This is the NBA App from me (Jannes von Reeken)

Since you should not share your API Key & you have to pay if you make too many API calls per day, please create your own account & insert your own Key in app/src/main/java/com/example/androidjannes/network/NbaApiService.kt
(Here is the link to the API: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba/ )

Replace the "Placeholder" with your own API Key.

API Keys from older commits will not work.

If you have any questions (especially because of the Key) just write me an email
