This is the NBA App from me (Jannes von Reeken)

Since you should not share your API Key & you have to pay if you make too many API calls per day, please create your own account & insert your own Key in app/src/main/java/com/example/androidjannes/network/NbaApiService.kt

API Keys from older commits will not work.

(Here is the link to the API: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba/ )
If you have any questions (especially because of the Key) just write me an email
